abstract = {The important role of liquid water in many areas of science from chemistry, physics, biology, geology to climate research, etc., has motivated numerous theoretical studies of its structure and dynamics. The significance of quantum effects on the properties of water, however, has not yet been fully resolved. In this paper we focus on quantum dynamical effects in liquid water based on the linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) with a quantum version of the simple point charge/flexible (q-SPC/fw) model [Paesani et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 184507 (2006)] for the potential energy function. The infrared (IR) absorption spectrum and the translational diffusion constants have been obtained from the corresponding thermal correlation functions, and the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular correlations have been studied. The LSC-IVR simulation results are compared with those predicted by the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) approach. Although the LSC-IVR and CMD results agree well for the broadband for hindered motions in liquid water, the intramolecular bending and O-H stretching peaks predicted by the LSC-IVR are blueshifted from those given by CMD; reasons for this are discussed. We also suggest that the broadband in the IR spectrum corresponding to restricted translation and libration gives more information than the diffusion constant on the nature of quantum effects on translational and rotational motions and should thus receive more attention in this regard.},

abstract = {The parallel tempering simulation method was recently extended to allow for possible exchanges between non-adjacent replicas. We introduce a multiple-exchange variant which naturally incorporates the information from all replicas when calculating statistical averages, building on the related virtual-move method of Coluzza and Frenkel (ChemPhysChem 2005, 6, 1779). The method is extensively tested on three model systems, namely, a Lennard-Jones cluster exhibiting a finite size phase transition, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model. In all cases, the present method performs significantly better and converges faster than conventional parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations. The standard deviations are also systematically decreased with respect to virtual moves.},

The corresponding collective variables are used in many applications, e.g., to understand the reaction mechanism, to quantify the system's free energy landscape, to enhance the sampling of the reaction path, and to determine the reaction rate. In this review we focus on a number of key developments in this field, providing an overview of several methods along with their relative regimes of applicability.},

The results obtained with this approach compare remarkably well with those determined previously with path integrals simulations as well as those obtained from the standard CMD method employing flexible models.

abstract = {Multiple time scale molecular dynamics enhances computational efficiency by updating slow motions less frequently than fast motions. However, in practice, the largest outer time step possible is limited not by the physical forces but by resonances between the fast and slow modes. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by using a simple colored noise thermostatting scheme which selectively targets the high frequency modes in the system. For two sample problems, flexible water and solvated alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that this allows the use of large outer time steps while still obtaining accurate sampling and minimizing the perturbation of the dynamics. Furthermore, this approach is shown to be comparable to constraining fast motions, thus providing an alternative to molecular dynamics with constraints.},

abstract = {Water-metal interfaces are ubiquitous and play a key role in many chemical processes, from catalysis to corrosion. Whereas water adlayers on atomically flat transition metal surfaces have been investigated in depth, little is known about the chemistry of water on stepped surfaces, commonly occurring in realistic situations. Using first-principles simulations, we study the adsorption of water on a stepped platinum surface. We find that water adsorbs preferentially at the step edge, forming linear clusters or chains, stabilized by the cooperative effect of chemical bonds with the substrate and hydrogen bonds. In contrast with their behavior on flat Pt, at steps water molecules dissociate, forming mixed hydroxyl/water structures, through an autocatalytic mechanism promoted by H-bonding. Nuclear quantum effects contribute to stabilize partially dissociated cluster and chains. Together with the recently demonstrated behavior of water chains adsorbed on stepped Pt surfaces to transfer protons via thermally activated hopping, these findings make these systems viable candidates for proton wires.},

abstract = {Parallel tempering (or the replica exchange method (REM)) is a powerful method for speeding up the sampling of conformational states of systems with rough energy landscapes, like proteins, where stable conformational states can be separated by large energy barriers. The usual implementation of the REM is performed on local computer clusters (or parallel processors) where the different replicas must be run synchronously. Here, we present serial replica exchange (SREM), a method that is equivalent to the standard REM in terms of efficiency yet runs asynchronously on a distributed network of computers. A second advantage is the method's greatly enhanced fault tolerance, which enables the study of biological systems on worldwide distributed computing environments, such as Folding@Home. For proof of concept, we apply the SREM to a single alanine dipeptide molecule in explicit water. We show that the SREM reproduces the thermodynamic and structural properties determined by the REM.},

abstract = {We investigate the structure, topology, and dynamics of liquid water at the interface with natively hydroxylated (001) surfaces of InP and GaP photoelectrodes. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that contact with the semiconductor surface enhances the water hydrogen-bond strength at the interface. This leads to the formation of an ice-like structure, within which dynamically driven water dissociation and local proton hopping are amplified. Nevertheless, the structurally similar and isovalent InP and GaP surfaces generate qualitatively different interfacial water dynamics. This can be traced to slightly more covalent-like character in the binding of surface adsorbates to GaP, which results in a more rigid hydrogen-bond network that limits the explored topological phase space. As a consequence, local proton hopping can give rise to long-range surface proton transport on InP, whereas the process is kinetically limited on GaP. This allows for spatial separation of individual stages of hydrogen-evolving, multistep reactions on InP(001). Possible implications for the mechanisms of cathodic water splitting and photocorrosion on the two surfaces are considered in light of available experimental evidence.},

abstract = {The dynamical properties of liquid water play an important role in many processes in nature. In this paper, we focus on the infrared (IR) absorption spectrum of liquid water based on the linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) with the local Gaussian approximation (LGA) [J. Liu and W. H. Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 074113 (2009)] and an ab initio based, flexible, polarizable Thole-type model (TTM3-F) [G. S. Fanourgakis and S. S. Xantheas, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 074506 (2008)]. Although the LSC-IVR (LGA) gives the exact result for the isolated three-dimensional shifted harmonic stretching model, it yields a blueshifted peak position for the more realistic anharmonic stretching potential. By using the short-time information of the LSC-IVR correlation function; however, it is shown how one can obtain more accurate results for the position of the stretching peak. Due to the physical decay in the condensed phase system, the LSC-IVR (LGA) is a good and practical approximate quantum approach for the IR spectrum of liquid water. The present results offer valuable insight into future attempts to improve the accuracy of the TTM3-F potential or other ab initio-based models in reproducing the IR spectrum of liquid water.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

They introduce two variables that are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated. The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes of alanine dipeptide.},

Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast, strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton conductivity.},

abstract = {We examine the short-time accuracy of a class of approximate quantum dynamical techniques that includes the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods. Both of these methods are based on the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) technique for calculating the exact static equilibrium properties of quantum mechanical systems. For Kubo-transformed real-time correlation functions involving operators that are linear functions of positions or momenta, the RPMD and (adiabatic) CMD approximations differ only in the choice of the artificial mass matrix of the system of ring polymer beads that is employed in PIMD. The obvious ansatz for a general method of this type is therefore to regard the elements of the PIMD (or Parrinello-Rahman) mass matrix as an adjustable set of parameters that can be chosen to improve the accuracy of the resulting approximation. We show here that this ansatz leads uniquely to the RPMD approximation when the criterion that is used to select the mass matrix is the short-time accuracy of the Kubo-transformed correlation function. In particular, we show that the leading error in the RPMD position autocorrelation function is O(t(8)) and the error in the velocity autocorrelation function is O(t(6)), for a general anharmonic potential. The corresponding errors in the CMD approximation are O(t(6)) and O(t(4)), respectively.},

abstract = {The theory underlying the Car-Parrinello extended-Lagrangian approach to ab initio molecular dynamics (CPMD) is reviewed and reexamined using "heavy" ice as a test system. It is emphasized that the adiabatic decoupling in CPMD is not a decoupling of electronic orbitals from the ions but only a decoupling of a subset of the orbital vibrational modes from the rest of the necessarily coupled system of orbitals and ions. Recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 14 (2002)] has pointed out that, due to the orbital-ion coupling that remains once adiabatic decoupling has been achieved, a large value of the fictitious mass mu can lead to systematic errors in the computed forces in CPMD. These errors are further investigated in the present work with a focus on those parts of these errors that are not corrected simply by rescaling the masses of the ions. It is suggested that any comparison of the efficiencies of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and CPMD should be performed at a similar level of accuracy. If accuracy is judged according to the average magnitude of the systematic errors in the computed forces, the efficiency of BOMD compares more favorably to that of CPMD than previous comparisons have suggested.},

abstract = {Modern methods of quantum mechanics have proved to be effective tools to understand and even predict materials properties. An essential element of the materials design process, relevant to both new materials and the optimization of existing ones, is knowing which crystal structures will form in an alloy system. Crystal structure can only be predicted effectively with quantum mechanics if an algorithm to direct the search through the large space of possible structures is found. We present a new approach to the prediction of structure that rigorously mines correlations embodied within experimental data and uses them to direct quantum mechanical techniques efficiently towards the stable crystal structure of materials.},

Acta 37, 329 (1975), in which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix, is restated as a formula involving the density and local kinetic-energy density. On insertion of gradient expansions for the local kinetic-energy density, density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then obtained. Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.},

abstract = {A quantum simulation of an imaginary time path integral typically requires around n times more computational effort than the corresponding classical simulation, where n is the number of ring polymer beads (or imaginary time slices) used in the calculation. However, this estimate neglects the fact that the potential energies of many systems can be decomposed into a sum of rapidly varying short-range and slowly varying long-range contributions. For such systems, the computational effort of the path integral simulation can be reduced considerably by evaluating the long-range forces on a contracted ring polymer with fewer beads than are needed to evaluate the short-range forces. This idea is developed and then illustrated with an application to a flexible model of liquid water in which the intramolecular forces are evaluated with 32 beads, the oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones forces with seven, and the intermolecular electrostatic forces with just five. The resulting static and dynamic properties are within a few percent of those of a full 32-bead calculation, and yet they are obtained with a computational effort less than six times (rather than 32 times) that of a classical simulation. We hope that this development will encourage future studies of quantum mechanical fluctuations in liquid water and aqueous solutions and in many other systems with similar interaction potentials.},

This scheme does not rely on the localization of the orbitals and is insensitive to ill-conditioned Hamiltonians. It lends itself naturally to linear scaling as soon as the sparsity of the system's density matrix is exploited. By using a combination of polynomial expansion and Newton-like iterative techniques, an arbitrarily large number of terms can be employed in the expansion, overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in previous papers. Moreover, this hybrid approach allows us to obtain a very favorable scaling of the computational cost with increasing inverse temperature, which makes the method competitive with other Fermi operator expansion techniques. After performing an in-depth theoretical analysis of computational cost and accuracy, we test our approach on the density functional theory Hamiltonian for the metallic phase of the LiAl alloy.},

At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

abstract = {When examining complex problems, such as the folding of proteins, coarse grained descriptions of the system drive our investigation and help us to rationalize the results. Oftentimes collective variables (CVs), derived through some chemical intuition about the process of interest, serve this purpose. Because finding these CVs is the most difficult part of any investigation, we recently developed a dimensionality reduction algorithm, sketch-map, that can be used to build a low-dimensional map of a phase space of high-dimensionality. In this paper we discuss how these machine-generated CVs can be used to accelerate the exploration of phase space and to reconstruct free-energy landscapes. To do so, we develop a formalism in which high-dimensional configurations are no longer represented by low-dimensional position vectors. Instead, for each configuration we calculate a probability distribution, which has a domain that encompasses the entirety of the low-dimensional space. To construct a biasing potential, we exploit an analogy with metadynamics and use the trajectory to adaptively construct a repulsive, history-dependent bias from the distributions that correspond to the previously visited configurations. This potential forces the system to explore more of phase space by making it desirable to adopt configurations whose distributions do not overlap with the bias. We apply this algorithm to a small model protein and succeed in reproducing the free-energy surface that we obtain from a parallel tempering calculation.},

Whereas hydrogen for transportation applications is currently stored using cryogenics or high pressure, there is substantial research and development activity in the use of novel condensed-phase hydride materials. However, the multiple-target criteria accepted as necessary for the successful implementation of such stores have not yet been met by any single material. Ammonia borane, NH3BH3, is one of a number of condensed-phase compounds that have received significant attention because of its reported release of approximately 12 wt\% hydrogen at moderate temperatures (approximately 150 degrees C). However, the hydrogen purity suffers from the release of trace quantities of borazine. Here, we report that the related alkali-metal amidoboranes, LiNH2BH3 and NaNH2BH3, release approximately 10.9 wt\% and approximately 7.5 wt\% hydrogen, respectively, at significantly lower temperatures (approximately 90 degrees C) with no borazine emission. The low-temperature release of a large amount of hydrogen is significant and provides the potential to fulfil many of the principal criteria required for an on-board hydrogen store.},

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute "ab initio molecular simulations" (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

Adding the dispersion correction due to Grimme (1, 2) improves the predicted densities for both BLYP and PBE in a significant manner. Moreover, the addition of the dispersion correction for BLYP yields an oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function in excellent agreement with experiment. Thus, we conclude that one can obtain a very satisfactory model for water using BLYP and a correction for dispersion.},

At present, most ab initio molecular dynamics calculations are restricted to relatively small systems and short simulation times. In this paper we devise a method that allows well-converged results for infrared spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using small systems and short trajectories characteristic of simulations typically performed in practice. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by computing the imaginary part of the dielectric constant epsilon"(omega) for H2O and D2O in solid and liquid phases and show that it compares well with experimental data. We further demonstrate that maximally localized Wannier orbitals can be used to separate the individual contributions of different molecular species to the linear spectrum of complex systems. The new spectral decomposition method is shown to be useful in present-day ab initio molecular dynamics calculations to compute the magnitude of the "continuous absorption" generated by excess protons in aqueous solutions with good accuracy even when other species present in the solutions absorb strongly in the same frequency window.},

For C16 and C24 we extract three global order parameters with which we characterize the fundamental dynamics, and determine that the low free-energy pathway of globular collapse proceeds by a "kink and slide" mechanism, whereby a bend near the end of the linear chain migrates toward the middle to form a hairpin and, ultimately, a coiled helix. The low-dimensional representation is subtly perturbed in the solvated phase relative to the ideal gas, and its geometric structure is conserved between C16 and C24. The methodology is directly extensible to biomolecular self-assembly processes, such as protein folding.},

It is, therefore, crucial for us to understand the dehydrogenation mechanism of these materials for further development towards making successful hydrogen-storage media. In the present study, we attempt to shed light on the mechanisms involved in the loss of one molar equivalent of H(2) from solid lithium amidoboranes by using high-level ab initio calculations of monomeric and dimeric compounds in the gas phase. In the lithium amidoborane dimer, H(2) is released by the formation of LiH, which is followed by a redox reaction of the dihydrogen bond formed between the strongly basic H(-) in LiH and H(delta+) bonded to N. In the dehydrogenation process, the Li cation catalyzes the intermolecular N-B bond formation; this could lead to new pathways for N-B polymerization. After the release of the first molecule of H(2), a Li cation binds to a nitrogen atom, resulting in a lowering of the energy barrier for the second dehydrogenation process per dimer. These results will be useful for the design of future hydrogen-storage media.},

abstract = {The mono-, di-, and tetrahydrates of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, which contain characteristic H(3)O(+), H(5)O(2)(+), and H(9)O(4)(+) structures, provide model systems for understanding proton transport in materials with high perfluorosulfonic acid density such as perfluorosulfonic acid membranes commonly employed in hydrogen fuel cells. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that protons in these solids are predisposed to transfer to the water most strongly bound to sulfonate groups via a Grotthuss-type mechanism, but quickly return to the most solvated defect structure either due to the lack of a nearby species to stabilize the new defect or a preference for the proton to be maximally hydrated. Path integral molecular dynamics of the mono- and dihydrate reveal significant quantum effects that facilitate proton transfer to the "presolvated" water or SO(3)(-) in the first solvation shell and increase the Zundel character of all the defects. These trends are quantified in free energy profiles for each bonding environment. Hydrogen bonding criteria for HOH-OH(2) and HOH-O(3)S are extracted from the two-dimensional potential of mean force. The quantum radial distribution function, radius of gyration, and root-mean-square displacement position correlation function show that the protonic charge is distributed over two or more water molecules. Metastable structural defects with one excess proton shared between two sulfonate groups and another Zundel or Eigen type cation defect are found for the mono- and dihydrate but not for the tetrahydrate crystal. Results for the tetrahydrate native crystal exhibit minor differences at 210 and 250 K. IR spectra are calculated for all native and stable defect structures. Graph theory techniques are used to characterize the chain lengths and ring sizes in the hydrogen bond network. Low conductivities when limited water is present may be attributable to trapping of protons between SO(3)(-) groups and the increased probability that protons transfer to waters bridging two different sulfonate groups.},

The crystalline fraction and grain size of these films determines electronic and optical properties; the nanocrystal nucleation mechanism, which dictates the final film structure, is governed by the interactions between the hydrogen atoms of the plasma and the solid silicon matrix. Fundamental understanding of these interactions is important for optimizing the film structure and properties. Here we report the mechanism of hydrogen-induced crystallization of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films during post-deposition treatment with an H(2) (or D(2)) plasma. Using molecular-dynamics simulations and infrared spectroscopy, we show that crystallization is mediated by the insertion of H atoms into strained Si-Si bonds as the atoms diffuse through the film. This chemically driven mechanism may be operative in other covalently bonded materials, where the presence of hydrogen leads to disorder-to-order transitions.},

abstract = {The hydrogen bond (HB) is central to our understanding of the properties of water. However, despite intense theoretical and experimental study, it continues to hold some surprises. Here, we show from an analysis of ab initio simulations that take proper account of nuclear quantum effects that the hydrogen-bonded protons in liquid water experience significant excursions in the direction of the acceptor oxygen atoms. This generates a small but nonnegligible fraction of transient autoprotolysis events that are not seen in simulations with classical nuclei. These events are associated with major rearrangements of the electronic density, as revealed by an analysis of the computed Wannier centers and (1)H chemical shifts. We also show that the quantum fluctuations exhibit significant correlations across neighboring HBs, consistent with an ephemeral shuttling of protons along water wires. We end by suggesting possible implications for our understanding of how perturbations (solvated ions, interfaces, and confinement) might affect the HB network in water.},

abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

abstract = {Surprisingly, there exists a quantum flux-side time-correlation function which has a non-zero t → 0+ limit and thus yields a rigorous quantum generalization of classical transition-state theory (TST). In this Part I of two articles, we introduce the new time-correlation function and derive its t → 0+ limit. The new ingredient is a generalized Kubo transform which allows the flux and side dividing surfaces to be the same function of path-integral space. Choosing this function to be a single point gives a t → 0+ limit which is identical to an expression introduced on heuristic grounds by Wigner in 1932; however, this expression does not give positive-definite quantum statistics, causing it to fail while still in the shallow-tunnelling regime. Positive-definite quantum statistics is obtained only if the dividing surface is invariant to imaginary-time translation, in which case the t → 0+ limit is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. The RPMD-TST rate is not a strict upper bound to the exact quantum rate, but is a good approximation to one if real-time coherence effects are small. Part II will show that the RPMD-TST rate is equal to the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing.},

Quantum effects on nuclear motion have been included through a quantum thermal bath (QTB). The interatomic forces were described either within the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or by the phenomenological approach using the shell model. For both models, the isotopic shift in the lattice parameter can be successfully predicted by QTB-MD simulations. The slope of the experimental isotopic shift in pressure is satisfactorily reproduced by QTB-MD within DFT-GGA, in contrast to both density functional perturbation theory and QTB-MD with the shell model. We have analyzed the reasons for these discrepancies through the vibrational densities of states and the isotopic shifts in bulk modulus. The results illustrate the importance of anharmonic contributions to vibrations and to the isotopic pressure shift between LiH and LiD.},

abstract = {The motion of the excess proton is understood as a process involving interconversion between two limiting states, namely, the Eigen and Zundel cations. Nuclear quantum effects (NQE) and the organization of the surrounding solvent play a significant role in this process. However, little is known about how these factors can change the limiting state in molecular systems and the physicochemical properties of its surrounding hydrogen-bond environment. In this work we use state of the art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine the role of NQE on the nature of the proton in four hydrogen chloride hydrates. We demonstrate that NQE significantly alter the phase space properties of the proton and that the local electronic structure of the proton is an exquisitely sensitive indicator of the limiting state in each of the crystals. We evaluate both the proton momentum distribution and the proton chemical shifts and demonstrate that deep inelastic neutron scattering and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can serve as complementary techniques for probing the quantum nature of the proton in hydrogen-bonding systems. We believe that the rich and insightful information we obtain for these acid hydrates provides a motivation for new experimental studies.},

abstract = {We have used the ring polymer molecular dynamics method to study the Azzouz-Borgis model for proton transfer between phenol (AH) and trimethylamine (B) in liquid methyl chloride. When the A-H distance is used as the reaction coordinate, the ring polymer trajectories are found to exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state dividing surface and to give a rate coefficient that is smaller than the quantum transition state theory value by an order of magnitude. This is to be expected on kinematic grounds for a heavy-light-heavy reaction when the light atom transfer coordinate is used as the reaction coordinate, and it clearly precludes the use of transition state theory with this reaction coordinate. As has been shown previously for this problem, a solvent polarization coordinate defined in terms of the expectation value of the proton transfer distance in the ground adiabatic quantum state provides a better reaction coordinate with less recrossing. These results are discussed in light of the wide body of earlier theoretical work on the Azzouz-Borgis model and the considerable range of previously reported values for its proton and deuteron transfer rate coefficients.},

The water reorientation is shown to occur through large-amplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches.},

Inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy of the rotational transitions of the adsorbed hydrogen molecules indicates the presence of two well-defined binding sites (termed I and II), which we associate with hydrogen binding to zinc and the BDC linker, respectively. Preliminary studies on topologically similar isoreticular metal-organic framework-6 and -8 (IRMOF-6 and -8) having cyclobutylbenzene and naphthalene linkers, respectively, gave approximately double and quadruple (2.0 weight percent) the uptake found for MOF-5 at room temperature and 10 bar.},

The law, called the incomplete beta function law, is valid in the limit that the two temperatures involved in swaps are close to one another. An empirical version of the law, which involves the heat capacity of the system, is developed and tested on a Lennard-Jones cluster. We argue that the best initial guess for the distribution of intermediate temperatures for parallel tempering is a geometric progression and we also propose a technique for the computation of optimal temperature schedules. Finally, we demonstrate that the swap efficiency of the parallel tempering method for condensed-phase systems decreases naturally to zero at least as fast as the inverse square root of the dimensionality of the physical system.},

The simulations revealed that the dissociated proton was preferentially stabilized as a hydrated hydronium cation (i.e., Eigen like) in the fluorinated CNTs but as a Zundel (H(5)O(2)(+)) cation in the nonfluorinated CNTs. This feature is attributed to the fluorine atoms forming hydrogen bonds with the water molecules coordinated to the central hydronium ion.},

The neutralization step once the solvated ions are in close proximity is phenomenologically understood to be fast, but the molecular mechanism has not been directly probed by experiments. We elucidate the mechanism of recombination in liquid water with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and it emerges as quite different from the conventional view of the Grotthuss mechanism. The neutralization event involves a collective compression of the water-wire bridging the ions, which occurs in approximately 0.5 ps, triggering a concerted triple jump of the protons. This process leaves the neutralized hydroxide in a hypercoordinated state, with the implications that enhanced collective compressions of several water molecules around similarly hypercoordinated states are likely to serve as nucleation events for the autoionization of liquid water.},

The H-bond cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered. This water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, rather than the commonly accepted sequence of small diffusive steps, and therefore calls for reinterpretation of many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation is assumed to be diffusive.},

This behavior is qualitatively unaffected by a transition at 0.19 GPa to a new phase Ag3[Co(CN)6]-II, whose structure is reported here. The high-pressure phase also shows anisotropic thermal expansion with large uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE, expansion on cooling). In both phases, the NLC/NTE effect arises as the rapid compression/contraction of layers of silver atoms\{---\}weakly bound via argentophilic interactions\{---\}is translated via flexing of the covalent network lattice into an expansion along a perpendicular direction.

The results obtained for structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and spectroscopic (magnetic, infrared and electronic) properties are satisfactory and not far from those delivered by the most reliable functionals including heavy parameterization. The way in which the functional is derived and the lack of empirical parameters fitted to specific properties make the PBE0 model a widely applicable method for both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.},

abstract = {The diffusion of protons through water is understood within the framework of the Grotthuss mechanism, which requires that they undergo structural diffusion in a stepwise manner throughout the water network. Despite long study, this picture oversimplifies and neglects the complexity of the supramolecular structure of water. We use first-principles simulations and demonstrate that the currently accepted picture of proton diffusion is in need of revision. We show that proton and hydroxide diffusion occurs through periods of intense activity involving concerted proton hopping followed by periods of rest. The picture that emerges is that proton transfer is a multiscale and multidynamical process involving a broader distribution of pathways and timescales than currently assumed. To rationalize these phenomena, we look at the 3D water network as a distribution of closed directed rings, which reveals the presence of medium-range directional correlations in the liquid. One of the natural consequences of this feature is that both the hydronium and hydroxide ion are decorated with proton wires. These wires serve as conduits for long proton jumps over several hydrogen bonds.},

The silane molecule (SiH4) is adsorbed on to the surface at a number of different sites (on dimer, interrow, or intrarow) with varying barrier heights. Two distinct structures, which are similar in energy, arise from the initial dissociative reaction SiH4-->SiH3(silyl) + H, where the dissociated species are adsorbed either on the same dimer components or on adjacent dimer components. Several further decays of silyl from SiH4 are presented in two separate regimes of high and low ambient hydrogen coverages. The decomposition of silyl can form two different bridging structures: an on top or an intrarow bridging structure in both of the two hydrogen coverage regimes. The disilane molecule (Si2H6) is also adsorbed upon this surface with varying energy barriers, resulting in a dissociation reaction where two SiH3 species are adsorbed on one dimer or in an adjacent dimer configuration. Plausible energy reaction paths for the above models are presented. The stability of the SiH2 species is also discussed.},

The methods are based on the Takahashi-Imada and Susuki decompositions of the Boltzmann operator. The methods introduced improve the averages of the estimators by using the classical forces needed to carry out the dynamics to construct a posteriori weighting factors for standard path integral molecular dynamics. The new approaches are straightforward to implement in existing path integral codes and carry no significant overhead. The Suzuki higher order factorization was also used to improve the end-to-end distance estimator in open path integral molecular dynamics. The new schemes are tested in various model systems, including an ab initio path integral molecular dynamics calculation on the hydrogen molecule and a quantum water model. The proposed algorithms have potential utility for reducing the cost of path integral molecular dynamics calculations of bulk systems.},

abstract = {When BaZrO(3) is doped with Y in 12.5\% of Zr sites, density functional theory with the PBE functional predicts octahedral distortions within a cubic phase yielding a greater variety of proton binding sites than undoped BaZrO(3). Proton binding sites, transition states, and normal modes are found and used to calculate transition state theory rate constants. The binding sites are used to represent vertices in a graph. The rate constants connecting binding sites are used to provide weights for graph edges. Vertex and color coding are used to find proton conduction pathways in BaZr(0.875)Y(0.125)O(3). Many similarly probable proton conduction pathways which can be periodically replicated to yield long range proton conduction are found. The average limiting barriers at 600 K for seven step and eight step periodic pathways are 0.29 and 0.30 eV, respectively. Inclusion of a lattice reorganization barrier raises these to 0.42 and 0.33 eV, respectively. The majority of the seven step pathways have an interoctahedral rate limiting step while the majority of the eight step pathways have an intraoctahedral rate limiting step. While the average limiting barrier of the seven step periodic pathway including a lattice reorganization barrier is closer to experiment, how to appropriately weight different length periodic pathways is not clear. Likely, conduction is influenced by combinations of different length pathways. Vertex and color coding provide useful ways of finding the wide variety of long range proton conduction pathways that contribute to long range proton conduction. They complement more traditional serial methods such as molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo.},

In this paper we show on the examples of the trans isomer of nitrous acid and naphthalene that both issues can be alleviated by preparing the initial conditions according to semiclassical quantization based on a normal mode representation. The method correctly reproduces fundamental frequencies obtained with quantum mechanical methods. At increasing temperatures, the effective frequencies are found to follow the same trends as path-integral based methods. In the low-temperature limit, the band intensities predicted by the method are also found to agree with quantum mechanical considerations.},

Vehicles can be run either by connecting them to a continuous supply of energy or by storing energy on board. Hydrogen would be ideal as a synthetic fuel because it is lightweight, highly abundant and its oxidation product (water) is environmentally benign, but storage remains a problem. Here we present recent developments in the search for innovative materials with high hydrogen-storage capacity.},

abstract = {The path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method provides a convenient way to compute the quantum mechanical structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed phase systems at the expense of introducing an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application in many future PIMD simulations.},

The mechanism of hydrogen release from metal amidoboranes, a metal ion assisted hydride transfer, is very different than the mechanism of hydrogen release from the parent compound ammonia borane (AB). On the basis of the observed trends in reaction rates of H > Me > (t)Bu, K > Na > Li, and the kinetic isotope effect, the mechanism of hydrogen release from MAB compounds was found to proceed through a bimolecular mechanism involving the intermediacy of a MH (M = Li, Na, or K). The non-volatile products formed from MABs are significantly different than the products formed after hydrogen release from AB. The boron containing products resulting from the release of 1 equiv of hydrogen from the metal amidoboranes were characterized by MAS (11)B NMR spectroscopy and found to contain both BH(3) and sp(2) hybridized BH groups, consistent with the general structure MN(R)=BHN(R)MBH(3).},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method is equivalent to an automated and approximate implementation of the "Im F" version of semiclassical instanton theory when used to calculate reaction rates in the deep-tunneling regime. This explains why the RPMD method is often reliable in this regime and also shows how it can be systematically improved. The geometry of the beads at the transition state on the ring-polymer potential surface describes a finite-difference approximation to the "instanton" trajectory (a periodic orbit in imaginary time beta variant Planck's over 2pi on the inverted potential surface). The deep-tunneling RPMD rate is an approximation to the rate obtained by applying classical transition-state theory (TST) in ring-polymer phase-space using the optimal dividing surface; this TST rate is in turn an approximation to a free-energy version of the Im F instanton rate. The optimal dividing surface is in general a function of several modes of the ring polymer, which explains why centroid-based quantum-TSTs break down at low temperatures for asymmetric reaction barriers. Numerical tests on one-dimensional models show that the RPMD rate tends to overestimate deep-tunneling rates for asymmetric barriers and underestimate them for symmetric barriers, and we explain that this is likely to be a general trend. The ability of the RPMD method to give a dividing-surface-independent rate in the deep-tunneling regime is shown to be a consequence of setting the bead-masses equal to the physical mass.},

The resulting diffusion coefficients are shown to be consistent with experimental shear viscosities and the established finite-size relation D(L) approximately = D(infinity)-2.837k(B)T6pietaL, where k(B) is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, eta the shear viscosity, and L the length of the (cubic) simulation cell. The diffusion coefficients D(L) obtained in simulations with finite system sizes are therefore too small. However, the extrapolation to infinite system size corrects this deficiency and leads to excellent agreement with experimental results. This both demonstrates the influence of system-size effects on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients and provides further evidence that ring-polymer molecular dynamics is an accurate as well as practical way of including quantum effects in condensed phase molecular dynamics.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The effects of quantization on the lattice vibrations, associated with the molecular translations and librations, are also reported. Comparison of quantum and classical simulation results indicates that shifts in the average potential energy are equivalent to rising the temperature about 80 K and are therefore non-negligible. The energy shifts due to quantization and the quantum mechanical uncertainties observed in ice are smaller than the values previously reported for liquid water.

abstract = {We present an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of the aqueous liquid-vapor interface. Having successfully stabilized a region of bulk water in the center of a water slab, we were able to reproduce and further quantify the experimentally observed abundance of surface "acceptor-only"(19\%) and "single-donor"(66\%) moieties as well as substantial surface relaxation approaching the liquid-vapor interface. Examination of the orientational dynamics points to a faster relaxation in the interfacial region. Furthermore, the average value of the dipole decreases and the average value of the highest occupied molecular orbital for each water molecule increases approaching the liquid-vapor interface. Our results support the idea that the surface contains, on average, far more reactive states than the bulk.},

abstract = {The Markov chain Monte Carlo method is an important tool to estimate the average properties of systems with a very large number of accessible states. This technique is used extensively in fields ranging from physics to genetics and economics. The rejection of trial configurations is a central ingredient in existing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. I argue that the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations can be enhanced, sometimes dramatically, by properly sampling configurations that are normally rejected. This "waste-recycling" of microstates is useful in sampling schemes in which only one of a large set of trial configurations is accepted. It differs fundamentally from schemes that extract information about the density of macrostates from virtual Monte Carlo moves. As a simple illustration, I show that the method greatly improves the calculation of the order-parameter distribution of a two-dimensional Ising model. This method should enhance the efficiency of parallel Monte Carlo simulations significantly.},

abstract = {The thermal Gaussian approximation (TGA) recently developed by Frantsuzov et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 381, 117 (2003)] has been demonstrated to be a practical way for approximating the Boltzmann operator exp(-betaH) for multidimensional systems. In this paper the TGA is combined with semiclassical (SC) initial value representations (IVRs) for thermal time correlation functions. Specifically, it is used with the linearized SC-IVR (LSC-IVR, equivalent to the classical Wigner model), and the "forward-backward semiclassical dynamics" approximation developed by Shao and Makri [J. Phys. Chem. A 103, 7753 (1999); 103, 9749 (1999)]. Use of the TGA with both of these approximate SC-IVRs allows the oscillatory part of the IVR to be integrated out explicitly, providing an extremely simple result that is readily applicable to large molecular systems. Calculation of the force-force autocorrelation for a strongly anharmonic oscillator demonstrates its accuracy, and calculation of the velocity autocorrelation function (and thus the diffusion coefficient) of liquid neon demonstrates its applicability.},

abstract = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO(2) emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO(2) levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

We utilize a flexible, single point charge empirical force field to model the system's interactions. The calculated momentum distributions depict both agreement and discrepancies with experiment. The differences may be explained by the deviation of the force field from the true interactions.

abstract = {The structure, dynamical, and electronic properties of liquid water utilizing different hybrid density functionals were tested within the plane wave framework of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. The computational approach, which employs modified functionals with short-ranged Hartree-Fock exchange, was first tested in calculations of the structural and bonding properties of the water dimer and cyclic water trimer. Liquid water simulations were performed at the state point of 350 K at the experimental density. Simulations included three different hybrid functionals, a meta-functional, four gradient-corrected functionals, and the local density and Hartree-Fock approximations. It is found that hybrid functionals are superior in reproducing the experimental structure and dynamical properties as measured by the radial distribution function and self-diffusion constant when compared to the pure density functionals. The local density and Hartree-Fock approximations show strongly over- and understructured liquids, respectively. Hydrogen bond analysis shows that the hybrid functionals give slightly smaller average numbers of hydrogen bonds than pure density functionals but similar hydrogen bond populations. The average molecular dipole moments in the liquid from the three hybrid functionals are lower than those of the corresponding pure density functionals.},

abstract = {The isotope effect in the melting temperature of ice Ih has been studied by free energy calculations within the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics. Free energy differences between isotopes are related to the dependence of their kinetic energy on the isotope mass. The water simulations were performed by using the q-TIP4P/F model, a point charge empirical potential that includes molecular flexibility and anharmonicity in the OH stretch of the water molecule. The reported melting temperature at ambient pressure of this model (T=251 K) increases by 6.5±0.5 and 8.2±0.5 K upon isotopic substitution of hydrogen by deuterium and tritium, respectively. These temperature shifts are larger than the experimental ones (3.8 and 4.5 K, respectively). In the classical limit, the melting temperature is nearly the same as that for tritiated ice. This unexpected behavior is rationalized by the coupling between intermolecular interactions and molecular flexibility. This coupling makes the kinetic energy of the OH stretching modes larger in the liquid than in the solid phase. However, the opposite behavior is found for intramolecular modes, which display larger kinetic energy in ice than in liquid water.},

abstract = {We have studied diffusion pathways of a silyl radical adsorbed on the hydrogenated Si (100)-(2x1) surface by density-functional theory. The process is of interest for the growth of crystalline silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Preliminary searches for migration mechanisms have been performed using metadynamics simulations. Local minima and transition states have been further refined by using the nudged-elastic-band method. Barriers for diffusion from plausible adsorption sites as low as 0.2 eV have been found, but trap states have also been spotted, leading to a more stable configuration, with escape barriers of 0.7 eV. Diffusion among weakly bound physisorbed states is also possible with very low activation barriers (<50 meV). However, desorption mechanisms (either as SiH3 or as SiH4) from physisorbed or more strongly bound adsorption configurations turn out to have activation energies similar to diffusion barriers. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on ab initio activation energies show that the silyl radical diffuses at most by a few lattice spacing before desorbing at temperatures in the range 300-1000 K.},

However, an accurate description of dispersion is highly challenging, with the most widely used electronic structure technique, density functional theory (DFT), failing to describe them with standard approximations. Therefore, applications of DFT to systems where dispersion is important have traditionally been of questionable accuracy. However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods. Here we discuss, classify, and evaluate some of the promising schemes to emerge in recent years.

Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond "wire," the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

Here we describe how a similar approach can be used to accelerate the convergence of path integral (PI) molecular dynamics to the exact quantum mechanical result in more strongly anharmonic systems exhibiting both zero point energy and tunnelling effects. The resulting PI-GLE method is illustrated with applications to a double-well tunnelling problem and to liquid water.},

Developing capture materials and processes that reduce the parasitic energy imposed by CCS is therefore an important area of research. We have developed a computational approach to rank adsorbents for their performance in CCS. Using this analysis, we have screened hundreds of thousands of zeolite and zeolitic imidazolate framework structures and identified many different structures that have the potential to reduce the parasitic energy of CCS by 30-40\% compared with near-term technologies.},

Here we present new insights into the nature of local interactions in water obtained using a novel energy-decomposition method. Our simulations reveal that although a water molecule forms, on average, two strong donor and two strong acceptor bonds, there is a significant asymmetry in the energy of these contacts. We demonstrate that this asymmetry is a result of small instantaneous distortions of hydrogen bonds, which appear as fluctuations on a time scale of hundreds of femtoseconds around the average symmetric structure. Furthermore, we show that the distinct features of the X-ray absorption spectra originate from molecules with high instantaneous asymmetry. Our findings have important implications as they help reconcile the symmetric and asymmetric views on the structure of water.},

abstract = {Proton transport (PT) in bulk liquid water and within a thin water-filled carbon nanotube has been examined using ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Barrierless proton transfer is observed in each case when quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) are accounted for. The key difference between the two systems is that in the nanotube facile PT is facilitated by a favorable pre-alignment of water molecules, whereas in bulk liquid water solvent reorganization is required prior to PT. Configurations where the quantum excess proton is delocalized over several adjacent water molecules along with continuous interconversion between different hydration states reveals that, as in liquid water, the hydrated proton under confinement is best described as a fluxional defect, rather than any individual idealized hydration state such as Zundel, Eigen, or the so-called linear H7O3(+) complex along the water chain. These findings highlight the importance of QNEs in intermediate strength hydrogen bonds (HBs) and explain why H(+) diffusion through nanochannels is impeded much less than other cations.},

While extensive efforts have been made to the existing techniques, there is no viable storage technology capable of meeting the DOE cost and performance targets at the present time. New materials with significantly improved hydrogen adsorption capability are needed. Microporous metal coordination materials (MMOM) are promising candidates for use as sorbents in hydrogen adsorption. These materials possess physical characteristics similar to those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) but also exhibit a number of improved features. Here, we report a novel MMOM structure and its room-temperature hydrogen adsorption properties.},

The energy decomposition analyses indicate that all density functionals considered significantly overestimate the contributions of charge transfer to the interaction energies. Moreover, in contrast to some studies that state that density functional theory (DFT) does not include dispersion interactions, we adopt a broader definition and conclude that for (H(2)O)(6) the short-range dispersion interactions recovered in the DFT calculations account about 75\% or more of the net (short-range plus long-range) dispersion energies obtained from the SAPT calculations.},

A cubic unit of (LiH)(4) is predicted to react readily with NH(3)BH(3) to form LiNH(2)BH(3) plus H(2). The (LiH)(4) tetramer enables dehydrogenation through the exchange of a hydride vertex of (LiH)(4) and NH(2)BH(3)(-) where NH(2)BH(3)(-) is formed when the hydride vertex of (LiH)(4) abstracts a proton from NH(3). The free energy of activation for loss of H(2) is reduced from 37.2 kcal/mol in NH(3)BH(3) to 11.0 kcal/mol in (LiH)(4) + NH(3)BH(3). Further, H(2) elimination from the (LiNH(2)BH(3))(2) dimer is predicted to be much easier than from the monomer which may suggest a cooperative H(2)-loss mechanism is possible in solid LiNH(2)BH(3). While two molecules of H(2) can be lost reversibly from (LiNH(2)BH(3))(2), loss of further H(2) molecules is more difficult but could occur if the lattice energy stabilization accompanying H(2) loss is sufficiently large.},

It significantly extends the range of accuracy of conventional local harmonic approximations (LHAs) used in the linearized semiclassical initial value representation/classical Wigner approximation for real time correlation functions. The key idea is realizing that a local Gaussian approximation (LGA) for the momentum distribution (from the Wigner function involving the Boltzmann operator) can be a good approximation even when a LHA for the potential energy surface fails. The model is applied here to two examples where imaginary frequencies play a significant role: the chemical reaction rate for a linear model of the H+H(2) reaction and an analogous asymmetric barrier--a case where the imaginary frequency of the barrier dominates the process--and for momentum autocorrelation functions in liquid para-hydrogen at two thermal state points (25 and 14 K under nearly zero external pressure). We also generalize the LGA model to the Feynman-Kleinert approximation.},

In this contribution, we present a density functional theory-based, high-throughput screening scheme that successfully uses these strategies to identify a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst. This alloy is synthesized and tested experimentally and shows improved HER performance compared with pure Pt, in agreement with the computational screening results.},

Analytical expressions for the autocorrelation function's variance have been derived. It has been found that two common ways of calculating the autocorrelation, moving-average and Fourier transform, exhibit different uncertainty characteristics. For periodic time series, the Fourier transform method is preferred because it gives smaller uncertainties that are uniform through all time lags. Based on these analytical results, a statistically robust method has been proposed to test the existence of correlations in a time series. The statistical test is verified by computer simulations and an application to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is discussed.},

abstract = {H(2) and D(2) adsorption on single-wall carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) have been measured at 77 K, and the experimental data were compared with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for adsorption of these hydrogen isotopes on a model SWNH. Quantum effects were included in the simulations through the Feynman-Hibbs effective potential. The simulation predictions show good agreement with the experimental results and suggest that the hydrogen isotope adsorption at 77 K can be successfully explained with the use of the effective potential. According to the simulations, the hydrogen isotopes are preferentially adsorbed in the cone part of the SWNH with a strong potential field, and quantum effects cause the density of adsorbed H(2) inside the SWNH to be 8-26\% smaller than that of D(2). The difference between H(2) and D(2) adsorption increases as pressure decreases because the quantum spreading of H(2), which is wider than that of D(2), is fairly effective at the narrow conical part of the SWNH model. These facts indicate that quantum effects on hydrogen adsorption depend on pore structures and are very important even at 77 K.},

abstract = {The shift in chemical equilibria due to isotope substitution is frequently exploited to obtain insight into a wide variety of chemical and physical processes. It is a purely quantum mechanical effect, which can be computed exactly using simulations based on the path integral formalism. Here we discuss how these techniques can be made dramatically more efficient, and how they ultimately outperform quasi-harmonic approximations to treat quantum liquids not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of computational cost. To achieve this goal we introduce path integral quantum mechanics estimators based on free energy perturbation, which enable the evaluation of isotope effects using only a single path integral molecular dynamics trajectory of the naturally abundant isotope. We use as an example the calculation of the free energy change associated with H/D and (16)O/(18)O substitutions in liquid water, and of the fractionation of those isotopes between the liquid and the vapor phase. In doing so, we demonstrate and discuss quantitatively the relative benefits of each approach, thereby providing a set of guidelines that should facilitate the choice of the most appropriate method in different, commonly encountered scenarios. The efficiency of the estimators we introduce and the analysis that we perform should in particular facilitate accurate ab initio calculation of isotope effects in condensed phase systems.},

However, these recent one-electron SIE-free functionals, while greatly improving the description of thermochemistry and reaction barriers in general, still exhibit many of the difficulties associated with SIE. Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE. After identifying the sufficient condition for functionals to be free from SIE, we focus on the symptoms and investigate the performance of most popular functionals.

We then argue that the effective fraction represents an adequate measure of the quality of the sampling technique, as far as swapping is concerned. Under the hypothesis that the correlation between successive exchanges is negligible, we propose a technique for the computation of the effective fraction, a technique that relies solely on the values of the acceptance probabilities obtained at the end of the simulation. The effective fraction is then utilized for the study of the efficiency of a popular swapping scheme in the context of parallel tempering in the canonical ensemble. For large dimensional oscillators, we show that the swapping probability that minimizes the computational effort is 38.74\%. By studying the parallel tempering swapping efficiency for a 13-atom Lennard-Jones cluster, we argue that the value of 38.74\% remains roughly the optimal probability for most systems with continuous distributions that are likely to be encountered in practice.},

The quantum simulation also reproduces the isotope effect. The heat capacity in the liquid D2O has been calculated to be 10\% higher than that of H2O, while it is 13\% higher in the experiment. The results demonstrate that the path-integral simulation is a promising approach to quantitatively evaluate the heat capacities for molecular systems, taking account of quantum-mechanical vibrations as well as strongly anharmonic motions.},

abstract = {The solvation and transport properties of the sulfonate-hydronium ion pair have been studied in hydrated Nafion through molecular dynamics simulation. Explicit proton and charge delocalization of the excess proton transport, via the Grotthuss hopping mechanism, were treated using the self-consistent multistate empirical valence bond (SCI-MS-EVB) method. The nature of the sulfonate-hydronium ion pair was characterized through analysis of free-energy profiles. It was found that, in general, the excess proton is solvated between two water molecules of a Zundel moiety while in the contact ion pair position, but then it transitions to an Eigen-like configuration in the solvent-separated pair position. Furthermore, the positive charge associated with the excess proton passes between the contact and solvent-separated ion pair positions through the Grotthuss mechanism rather than simple vehicular diffusion. The total proton diffusion was decomposed into vehicular and Grotthuss components and were found to be of the same relative magnitude, but with a strong negative correlation resulting in a smaller overall diffusion. Correlated motions between the ion pair were examined through the distinct portion of the van Hove correlation function, and a characteristic time scale of approximately 425 ps was observed. Additionally, the association of the hydrated proton with the hydrophobic polymer backbone suggests its amphiphile-like behavior (see Acc. Chem. Res. 2006, 39, 143; Phys. Rev. 1954, 95, 249; J. Chem.

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have identified large quantum mechanical effects in the dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have been overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O-H stretches are described by Morse-type functions. We have parametrized this model to give the correct liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infrared absorption frequencies in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. The model also reproduces the experimental temperature variation of the liquid density and affords reasonable agreement with the experimental melting temperature of hexagonal ice at atmospheric pressure. By comparing classical and quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of empirical water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However, this is offset by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions, and a slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infrared absorption spectrum.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy analytic continuation (MEAC) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods provide complementary approaches to the calculation of real time quantum correlation functions. RPMD becomes exact in the high temperature limit, where the thermal time betavariant Planck's over 2pi tends to zero and the ring polymer collapses to a single classical bead. MEAC becomes most reliable at low temperatures, where betavariant Planck's over 2pi exceeds the correlation time of interest and the numerical imaginary time correlation function contains essentially all of the information that is needed to recover the real time dynamics. We show here that this situation can be exploited by combining the two methods to give an improved approximation that is better than either of its parts. In particular, the MEAC method provides an ideal way to impose exact moment (or sum rule) constraints on a prior RPMD spectrum. The resulting scheme is shown to provide a practical solution to the "nonlinear operator problem" of RPMD, and to give good agreement with recent exact results for the short-time velocity autocorrelation function of liquid parahydrogen. Moreover these improvements are obtained with little extra effort, because the imaginary time correlation function that is used in the MEAC procedure can be computed at the same time as the RPMD approximation to the real time correlation function. However, there are still some problems involving long-time dynamics for which the RPMD+MEAC combination is inadequate, as we illustrate with an example application to the collective density fluctuations in liquid orthodeuterium.},

abstract = {We first show that a simple scaling of fluctuation coordinates defined in terms of a given reference point gives the conventional virial estimator in discretized path integral, where different choices of the reference point lead to different forms of the estimator (e.g., centroid virial). The merit of this procedure is that it allows a finite-difference evaluation of the virial estimator with respect to temperature, which totally avoids the need of higher-order potential derivatives. We apply this procedure to energy and heat-capacity calculations of the (H(2))(22) and Ne(13) clusters at low temperature using the fourth-order Takahashi-Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 53, 3765 (1984)] and Suzuki [Phys. Lett. A 201, 425 (1995)] propagators. This type of calculation requires up to third-order potential derivatives if analytical virial estimators are used, but in practice only first-order derivatives suffice by virtue of the finite-difference scheme above. From the application to quantum clusters, we find that the fourth-order propagators do improve upon the primitive approximation, and that the choice of the reference point plays a vital role in reducing the variance of the virial estimator.},

abstract = {The self-consistent phonons (SCP) method provides a consistent way to include anharmonic effects when treating a many-body quantum system at thermal equilibrium. The system is then described by an effective temperature-dependent harmonic Hamiltonian, which can be used to estimate the system's properties, such as its free energy or its vibrational spectrum. The numerical bottleneck of the method is the evaluation of Gaussian averages of the potential energy and its derivatives. Several algorithmic ideas/tricks are introduced to reduce the cost of such integration by orders of magnitude, e.g., relative to that of the previous implementation of the SCP approach by Calvo et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 074303 (2010)]. One such algorithmic improvement is the replacement of standard Monte Carlo integration by quasi-Monte Carlo integration utilizing low-discrepancy sequences. The performance of the method is demonstrated on the calculation of vibrational frequencies of pyrene. It is then applied to compute the free energies of five isomers of water hexamer using the WHBB potential of Bowman and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 094509 (2011)]. The present results predict the hexamer prism being thermodynamically most stable, with the free energy of the hexamer cage being about 0.2 kcal mol(-1) higher at all temperatures below T = 200 K.},

Our approach can easily be applied to any type of pseudopotential, and also has the advantage that it can be used to obtain estimates of the atomic forces that would arise if the real atoms were present, thus giving insight into the expected displacements in the real alloy. We have applied this VCA technique within the Vanderbilt ultrasoft-pseudopotential scheme to predict dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O-3 solid solution in its paraelectric and ferroelectric phases, respectively. Comparison with calculations performed on ordered alloy supercells and with data on parents compounds demonstrates the adequacy of using the VCA for this perovskite solid solution. In particular, the VCA approach reproduces the anomalous Born effective charges and the large value of the piezoelectric coefficients.},

abstract = {Atomic motions in molecules are not linear. This infers that nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods can outperform linear ones in analysis of collective atomic motions. In addition, nonlinear collective motions can be used as potentially efficient guides for biased simulation techniques. Here we present a simulation with a bias potential acting in the directions of collective motions determined by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. Ad hoc generated conformations of trans,trans-1,2,4-trifluorocyclooctane were analyzed by Isomap method to map these 72-dimensional coordinates to three dimensions, as described by Brown and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 064118 (2008)]. Metadynamics employing the three-dimensional embeddings as collective variables was applied to explore all relevant conformations of the studied system and to calculate its conformational free energy surface. The method sampled all relevant conformations (boat, boat-chair, and crown) and corresponding transition structures inaccessible by an unbiased simulation. This scheme allows to use essentially any parameter of the system as a collective variable in biased simulations. Moreover, the scheme we used for mapping out-of-sample conformations from the 72D to 3D space can be used as a general purpose mapping for dimensionality reduction, beyond the context of molecular modeling.},
